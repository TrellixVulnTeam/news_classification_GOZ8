# News Classification
### This is model classify the article into classes and for this we have used Support vector Machine (SVM) which is a new technique suitable for binary classification tasks
Model is trained under the data set and acuuracy calculated is 87%.SVM is strong because of its simple structure and it requires less number of features.
We have classifier_notebook.ipynb as notebook which can be opened in jupyter notebook and after installing modules.It is easy to train the model and svm_new.pkl file is created which is our model and thus it can be used for further predicting the classes.

### For model training you can see and run individually code in jupyter notebook
### Steps for running website:
Step 1: To run website you need to install all the python modules as flask, pickle, sklearn too.<br>Step 2: open cmd and locate app folder to your directory and run python app.py<br>Step 3: open browser and type obtained address from the cmd
