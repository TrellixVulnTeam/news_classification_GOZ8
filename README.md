# News Classification
### This is model classify the article into classes and for this we have used Support vector Machine (SVM) which is a new technique suitable for binary classification tasks
Model is trained under the data set and acuuracy calculated is 87%.SVM is strong because of its simple structure and it requires less number of features.
We have classifier_notebook.ipynb as notebook which can be opened in jupyter notebook and after installing modules.It is easy to train the model and svm_new.pkl file is created which is our model and thus it can be used for further predicting the classes.
